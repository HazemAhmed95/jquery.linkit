JavaScript and jQuery Projects
========================

My files from [a Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/projects-in-javascript-jquery/).

**JavaScript quiz** (Project 1) Lecture 3: JS basics. Lecture 4: Quiz, only radio buttons, no jQuery; answers in the JS file. [See it.](http://macloo.github.io/projects-javascript-jquery/JavaScript%20quiz/lecture4.html)

**jQuery content slider** (Project 2) Prev and Next buttons; setInterval() for auto-play. Pretty rigid. Not responsive. Two JS files: lecture9 is without auto-play and lecture9_b includes auto-play with both setInterval() and clearInterval(). [See it.](http://macloo.github.io/projects-javascript-jquery/jQuery%20content%20slider/lecture9.html)

**jQuery YouTube API search** (Project 3) This is kind of a nightmare. Lots of stuff shown and not explained in the tutorial. I made tons of comments in both my JS and my HTML. Got everything working. Learned a lot about how APIs work! [See it.](http://macloo.github.io/projects-javascript-jquery/jQuery%20YouTube%20API%20search/lecture12.html)

**jQuery accordion** (Project 4) An easy project, but with nice interaction thanks to "toggle." A typical show/hide FAQ design. [See it.](http://macloo.github.io/projects-javascript-jquery/jQuery%20accordion/lecture18.html)

**Ajax PHP shoutbox** (Project 5) There's a README in the folder with all my notes. This project was surprisingly easy and very clear. Might be because I worked with SQL for a couple of years, although that was a while back now. Very nice to learn about [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), a server with PHP and MySQL all configured and set up -- maybe the easiest code-related thing I have ever installed on a Mac. Because of the server technologies, I had to upload the live version of this project [here](http://weimergeeks.com/js_shoutbox/index.php). 

**Apple Style Thumbslider** (Project 6) This is a slide viewer with horizontal sliding actions and a "menu" of thumbnail images below it. It seems pretty adaptable. The auto play function was not well explained in the tutorial, but once I'd put in some effort searching and console.logging, I realized it is pretty cool. (Heavily commented.) [See it.](http://macloo.github.io/projects-javascript-jquery/Apple%20Style%20Thumbslider/lecture27.html)
